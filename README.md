# Reflekt
We created a [demo](https://xd.adobe.com/view/d781eeb2-8198-4b54-822a-b1c21acf7e92) in Adobe XD to see the proof of concept. 

## What is Reflekt?
Reflekt explores a new way to connect with others, regardless of appearance and race. We streamlined the application to easily find people that are seeking the same relationship goals as well as those with similar interests. The app features a user base connected to a Google Firebase backend that securely stores our users and their data. Users can make a profile with a username, hiding everything about their identity besides their personality, interests, and what they're seeking in others. 

## Components
Reflekt was built in Android Studio using Java and XML. The UI/UX was designed in Adobe XD with graphics created in Photoshop. Google Firebase serves as the database to store profiles, messages, and collated interests. 

## Requirements
The project was built in Android Studio 2.3.2 and uses an SDK of 25 or later.

## What's next for Reflekt?
We hope to move forward from our proof of concept and implement more of the UI. The actual implemented UI is extremely basic, but includes most necessary features. We are also missing features such as only showing users with the same relationship goals as the user, viewing profiles from messaging, and others.
